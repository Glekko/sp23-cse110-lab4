17. newArr is returned with containing [2, 4, 6]. The modifyArray function is called with the arguments [1, 2, 3] and doSomething as the callback function. Inside the modifyArray function, a new empty array called newArr is created. The modifyArray function iterates through the input array [1, 2, 3], and for each element, it calls the doSomething callback function. The doSomething function is called for each element in the input array, doubling the value of each element. The doubled value is then pushed into the newArr.
